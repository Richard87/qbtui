# qBitTorrent UI

    - Install dependencies: `npm install`
    - Build and watch for changes: `npm run watch`
    - Configure qBitTorrent alternative webui public to map to `./build`

## TODO:

-   [ ] Filter torrent list
-   [ ] Upload torrent and configure save path
-   [ ] Start/Stop/Delete torrent
-   [ ] Include all configurations from old qBitTorrent Webui
-   [ ] Translations (make script to convert upstream and use the same)

## Research

-   [ ] Would it be possible to use some Kubernetes Ingress-magic to show the corrent WebUI and override the regular one?
